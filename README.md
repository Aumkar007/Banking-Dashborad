### **1. Project Title / Headline**

🏦 **Banking Risk & Revenue Insights Dashboard**: A Real-World Power BI Project for Financial Analytics
An interactive analytics dashboard designed to visualize banking client profiles, evaluate credit risks, and support strategic decision-making using real financial data.

### **2. Short Description / Purpose**
The **Banking Risk & Revenue Insights Dashboard** is a comprehensive Power BI report created to help stakeholders in the financial sector understand client engagement, risk profiles, and product usage. It aims to minimize financial risk while lending by leveraging key metrics derived from client behavior and banking relationships.


### **3. Tech Stack**
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Primary platform for report creation and dashboard development
• 📂 **Power Query** – Used for data cleaning, custom column creation, and transformation
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated columns, KPI logic, and custom measures
• 📝 **Data Modeling** – Relationship design between tables (e.g., Clients, Banking, Advisors) to allow seamless cross-filtering
• 📁 **File Format** – .pbix for design and .png for exporting key dashboard visuals


### **4. Data Source**
**Source:** Simulated multi-table dataset mimicking real-world banking operations
This dataset includes client banking details, gender, investment advisors, and transactional periods across several interconnected tables. Keys such as Client ID and Relationship IDs are used to establish foreign key constraints for proper data modeling.


### **5. Features / Highlights**
#### • Business Problem
Banks face increasing pressure to manage credit risk while improving revenue from deposits, loans, and services. Manually evaluating applicants and client portfolios is inefficient and error-prone. A visual, data-driven solution was needed to help evaluate loan eligibility, client engagement, and deposit patterns.


#### • Goal of the Dashboard
To develop a comprehensive banking analytics dashboard that:
– Analyzes the financial behavior of clients (loans, deposits, account balances)
– Identifies high-risk clients through custom KPIs like Engagement Days and Processing Fees
– Supports faster decision-making on credit approvals and revenue optimization
– Helps stakeholders visualize client segments and strategic gaps


#### • Walkthrough of Key Visuals
• **Key KPIs (Top Panel)**
Displays metrics like Total Clients, Total Loans, Bank Deposits, Credit Card Balances, and Engagement Duration.
